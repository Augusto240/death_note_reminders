  <p>
    Welcome to Death Note Reminders, a unique task management application inspired by the popular anime and manga series Death Note.
  </p>
  
  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>
    This application transforms ordinary task management into a themed experience where:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Each task is treated as a "name" written in the Death Note</li>
    <li>Due dates represent "execution dates"</li>
    <li>Task descriptions become "execution details"</li>
    <li>Completed tasks are marked as "executed"</li>
    <li>Overdue tasks are highlighted to demand attention</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Create, view, update and delete entries in your Death Note</li>
    <li>Mark entries as "executed" when completed</li>
    <li>Filter by status (all, overdue, upcoming, completed)</li>
    <li>Search for specific names</li>
    <li>Filter by cause of death</li>
    <li>View statistics about your Death Note usage</li>
    <li>Themed interface inspired by the Death Note anime</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby <%= RUBY_VERSION %></li>
    <li>Rails <%= Rails.version %></li>
