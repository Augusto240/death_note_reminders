<div class="about-content">
  <p>
    Welcome to Death Note Reminders, a task management application inspired by the popular anime and manga series Death Note.
  </p>
  
  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <p>
    In this application, each task is treated as an "entry" in the Death Note:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>name</strong> represents the victim or task to be executed</li>
    <li>The <strong>description</strong> details the circumstances</li>
    <li>The <strong>execution date</strong> is when the task must be completed</li>
    <li>Once a task is <strong>executed</strong>, it's marked as completed</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Death Note Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The human whose name is written in this note shall die.</li>
    <li>This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their mind when writing his/her name.</li>
    <li>If the cause of death is written within the next 40 seconds of writing the person's name, it will happen.</li>
    <li>If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart attack.</li>
    <li>After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.</li>
  </ol>
